# disponens-omnia
disponens omnia is a programming language I have been working on. Intending to be as minimal as possible. Disponens omnia is not finished, a parser has not been completed, the only completed peice currently is the lexer

Here is a sample program:

```C


func main;
main = func () return int {
  int X;
  X = int 10;
  X += 10;
  return X;
}

// note: I am using C syntax highlighting so it may not be completely accurate
```
